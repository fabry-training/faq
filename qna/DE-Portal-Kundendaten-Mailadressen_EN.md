## Answer

* An email address has been defined for [Company] &rarr; <kbd>Master data</kbd>.
* This is used for **all communications** from fiskaltrust gmbh, both information on order transactions and invoices. Different email addresses for order notifications on the one hand and invoices on the other are not supported. 
* Enquiries about complaints, hardware orders or support requests (support@fiskaltrust.de) can be correctly assigned and processed via this email address. Requests with a different email address must first be assigned, which can delay information on complaints and searches. 
* Cash register operators always contact the cash register dealer, not fiskaltrust gmbh, with enquiries about an order or its roll-out.
