## Answer

* Log in to the [fiskaltrust.portal](https://portal.fiskaltrust.de/Account/Login?returnUrl=%2fHome%2fDashboard).
* Select <kbd>Shop</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Orders</kbd>.
* You can check the **status** of an order in the portal using the colour of the field:
    * **blue** stands for successful
    * **red** for not completed.
* You can filter for failed orders in the search bar by selecting the entry <kbd>failed</kbd>.
* At the <kbd>Templates done</kbd> or <kbd>Templates created</kbd> entry, the necessary entity elements could be created, but the creation of a cashbox based on the selected template failed. Then check the outlet's data again, such as postcode, city and VAT number. 
* Once this data is complete and the validity check of the VAT number has been carried out, report the problem and its presumed solution to the support team of fiskaltrust gmbh(support@fiskaltrust.de). They can use your information on the incident to initiate the order again. If this is successful, the field turns blue and is filled with <kbd>Shipping Notes completed</kbd>.
