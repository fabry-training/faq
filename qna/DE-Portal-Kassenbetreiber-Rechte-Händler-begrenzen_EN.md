## Answer

* Use <kbd>PosOperator</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Find merchant/consultant</kbd>, enter the email address of the cash register merchant and select <kbd>Find</kbd>. 
* In the further course, PosOperators can extend the access rights instead of <kbd>Write/Read</kbd> with <kbd>Full</kbd>, limit them to <kbd>Read only</kbd> or cancel them with the <kbd>Nothing</kbd> button. 
* The <kbd>Request Assignment - Select Merchant</kbd> button is used for confirmation by the PosDealer. They must accept the change with <kbd>accept</kbd>. 
* To grant access rights to the PosDealer again, the PosOperator must at least set them to <kbd>Write/Read</kbd> or extend them to <kbd>Full</kbd>.
