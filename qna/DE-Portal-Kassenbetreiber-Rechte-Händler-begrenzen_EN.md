## Answer

* Log in to the [fiskaltrust.portal](https://portal.fiskaltrust.de/Account/Login?returnUrl=%2fHome%2fDashboard).
* Use <kbd>PosOperator</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Find merchant/consultant</kbd>, enter the email address of the cash register merchant and select <kbd>Find</kbd>. 
* In the further course, PosOperators can leave the access rights at <kbd>Write/Read</kbd> or extend them with <kbd>Full</kbd>. With <kbd>Read only</kbd> the PosDealer's rights are severely limited and with the <kbd>Nothing</kbd> button they are removed.
* The <kbd>Request Assignment - Select Merchant</kbd> button is used for confirmation by the PosDealer. They must accept the change with <kbd>accept</kbd>. 
* To grant access rights to the PosDealer again, the PosOperator must at least set them to <kbd>Write/Read</kbd> or extend them to <kbd>Full</kbd>.
