## Answer
The technical structure of the fiskaly Cloud TSE (version 2, as of 07.06.2021) certified by the BSI (Federal Office for Information Security) differs from the currently used (non-certified) fiskaly Cloud TSE (version 1). 
 
We are currently in close contact with fiskaly regarding the technical structure of the certified Cloud TSE in version 2 in order to make it available in the short term in interaction with the fiskaltrust.middleware. In doing so, we also check and consider the availability in a data centre as well as the use on Android-based systems. 
This coordination effort is absolutely necessary due to possible adjustments on the part of fiskaltrust, which is why we ask for your patience. As soon as we have coordinated all information and details, we will inform you comprehensively.
