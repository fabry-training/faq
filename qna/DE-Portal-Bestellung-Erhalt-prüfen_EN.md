## Answer

* The package must be checked immediately upon delivery. Damage or defects or missing components must be reported immediately, no later than 5 days after delivery, using our [claim form](forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=xATQxbj7fU2tH7MXSX6lnMhlPV7MECtPrCS3ojqjPz9URTJVQ0VLMDMzNFdSN1FQNFVWUkYxU041My4u).  After that, we cannot guarantee any service.
* To technically check a defective TSE, refer to the instructions at [Procedure for hardware TSE and card reader complaints](docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/posdealers/get-started/after-sales/troubleshooting-hardware-tse-complaint#procedure-for-hardware-tse--and-card-reader-complaints).
* If you are considering a replacement, you will need the serial number of the TSE for the [claim form](forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=xATQxbj7fU2tH7MXSX6lnMhlPV7MECtPrCS3ojqjPz9URTJVQ0VLMDMzNFdSN1FQNFVWUkYxU041My4u). In the case of hardware, this may be on the device, but can in any case be found under <kbd>Configuration</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>SCU</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Foldout</kbd>, provided the TSE has ever been put into operation.Â
