## Answer

* Go to <kbd>Shop</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Orders</kbd> in the portal.
* If the order has been transferred to our portal, <kbd> Accepted</kbd> appears. This means that your order has arrived at fiskaltrust gmbh, but not at our shipping partner. Please report the problem to support, which must be verified with the shipping partner.
* After successful ordered hardware, the field shows the entry <kbd>InDelivery</kbd> and the shipping number which tells that the order is in shipment.
This can be used for [shipment tracking](https://www.ups.com/at/de/services/tracking.page) at UPS.
