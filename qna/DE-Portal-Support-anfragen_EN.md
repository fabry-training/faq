## Answer

* Unfortunately, we are unable to process enquiries from PosOperators in a qualified manner due to the lack of on-site knowledge of the respective configurations. PosOperators should therefore always contact their PosDealer.
 * When sending your enquiry to support@fiskaltrust.de, please use the e-mail address stored in [fiskaltrust.portal](https://portal.fiskaltrust.de/Account/Login?returnUrl=%2fHome%2fDashboard) ([Company] &rarr; <kbd>Master data</kbd>).
 * This e-mail address is linked to the customer account. This avoids delays due to manual assignments and supports us in complying with SLAs.

 * Provide a summary of the request in the subject line. This will assist in processing the enquiry and save steps if your enquiry needs to be turned into a case.
 * In case of problems with orders, please list the affected order numbers in the text (this starts with ORD):
    * Log in to the [fiskaltrust.portal](https://portal.fiskaltrust.de/Account/Login?returnUrl=%2fHome%2fDashboard).
    * In the portal, select <kbd>Shop</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Orders</kbd>.
 * Technical questions about a cashbox configuration please complete with the number of the cashbox:
    * Log in to the [fiskaltrust.portal](https://portal.fiskaltrust.de/Account/Login?returnUrl=%2fHome%2fDashboard).
    * To do this, go to in the respective account:
 <kbd>Configuration</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Cashbox</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Foldout</kbd>.
 * Log files are always helpful for technical questions, add to them if you have problems starting or running the fiskaltrust.Middleware.
 (See the articles in the portal at <kbd>Knowledge articles</kbd>).
