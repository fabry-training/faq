## Answer

The contact is not deleted, just no longer connected to your account.
(with <kbd>PosOperator</kbd>&rarr; <kbd>Overview</kbd>&rarr; <kbd>Search</kbd> and <kbd>Disable</kbd> as well as <kbd>Unauthorise</kbd>). 
* The PosOPerator can still log in to the [fiskaltrust.portal](https://portal.fiskaltrust.de/Account/Login?returnUrl=%2fHome%2fDashboard).
* Then at <kbd>PosOperator</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Find merchant/consultant</kbd> enter the email address of the PosDealer and select <kbd>Find</kbd>.
* Further on, leave the access rights at <kbd>Write/Read</kbd> and select the <kbd>Request Assignment - Dealer</kbd> button.
* The PosDealer checks the POS operator's request at <kbd>PosOperator</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Overview</kbd>. 
On the right, the <kbd>Accept</kbd> button can be used to accept the PosOPerator's request or <kbd>Cancel authorisation</kbd> to reject it.
