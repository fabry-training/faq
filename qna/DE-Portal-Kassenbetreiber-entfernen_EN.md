## Answer

* In your own account, select <kbd>PosOperator</kbd>&rarr; <kbd>Overview</kbd>&rarr; <kbd>Search</kbd> and <kbd>Disable</kbd>.
* Select <kbd>Search</kbd> again and then <kbd>Unauthorise</kbd>.
* After both connections have been cancelled, the PosOperator no longer appears in your overview list.
* This contact is not deleted, just no longer connected to your account.
