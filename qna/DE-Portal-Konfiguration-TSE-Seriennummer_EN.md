## Question

Where can I find the serial number of a TSE?

## Metadata tags

lang-en, market-de, middleware, PosCreator, PosDealer, Consultant

## Answer

* This may be on the unit in the case of hardware.
* Generally, you will find the serial number in the portal if the TSE has ever been activated and synchronised with the portal:
  * Log in to the [fiskaltrust.portal](https://portal.fiskaltrust.de/Account/Login?returnUrl=%2fHome%2fDashboard).
  * Select <kbd>PosOperator</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Overview</kbd> and <kbd>Search</kbd>.
  * In the account of the desired cash register operator, go to
<kbd>Configuration</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>SCU</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Foldout</kbd>.
